# Breakout Game
A modern, modular, and power‑up enhanced version of the classic Breakout game built with Python and Pygame.
This project was built as a learning-focused game development exercise with the goal of writing clean,
extendable, and well-structured code while going beyond a simple Breakout clone.

## How it works

### Ball
- Handles movement, wall collisions, paddle and brick interactions.

### Paddle
- Player-controlled horizontal movement.
- Can grow temporarily with power-ups.

### Bricks
- Different durability levels.
- Can drop power-ups when destroyed.

### Power-Ups
- **Double** → spawns 2 balls  
- **Triple** → spawns 3 balls  
- **Big Paddle** → increases paddle size for 12 seconds  

### Game Control
- Manages game loop, rendering, scoring, win/lose states.

## Future Improvements

- Multiple levels
- Animations
- Pause menu
- Leaderboard
- More power-ups
- Background music
